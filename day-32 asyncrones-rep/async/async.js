// Functions running in parallel with other functions are called asynchronous.

// Asynchronous functions take some time to complete.

// With asynchronous programming, JavaScript programs can start long-running tasks and continue running other tasks in parallel.

// However, asynchronous programs can be difficult to write and debug.

// Because of this, most modern asynchronous JavaScript methods don't use callbacks. Instead, asynchronous programming is solved using Promises and async-await.

// An async function always returns a Promise.

// JavaScript is a synchronous and single-threaded programming language.

// But you can perform asynchronous programming using callbacks, Promises, and async-await.

// async-await allows you to write asynchronous code in a synchronous manner.

// This makes the code more readable and easier to maintain.
